A module to work in the APE framework using outputs from the System for Atmospheric Modeling (SAM) 3d

As a part of my PhD path, I am doing experiments with the System for Atmospheric Modeling (SAM32, Khairoutdinov, M. F., and D.A. Randall, 2001: A cloud resolving model as a cloud parameterization in the NCAR Community Climate System Model: Preliminary Results. Geophys. Res. Lett., 28, 3617-3620)

I am currently working on analzing idealized experiments from an Available Potential Energy (APE) framework, focusing specially on the cyclogenesis process. 
This, naturally, establishes the kind of functionality I am implementing on these lines.

This is an attempt to order my scripting with the hope that it will be useful to other people wile forcing me to keep good developing practices.
